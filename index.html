        <h3>Welcome to My Page!</h3>

<p>I'm Stefan Koshy, and this is my Github page. I've dabbled with Git since about 2010, but I'm really hoping to use it more for my projects from 2012 onwards.</p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>Hi</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<h3>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>


    Create an ssh key per these instructions: https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git (hopefully it's working)
    Learn a lot about git: http://learn.github.com/p/intro.html (keep studying until you can create your own repo, create a branch, merge one branch into another, push pull, create a git hub account so you can play in your own repo).  I can't remember if you have done this type of work before.  Sorry!
    Setup apache, mysql, and drupal on your local machine and play around with a drupal install.
    Create two sites on your box one that responds to port 80 and one that responds to port 81 and are two completely different sites (no shared db or source tree).
    Run through this vim tutorial: http://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/Learn-Vim-Progressively/
    Here's some more interesting vim stuff that deals with customization: http://jrupac.wordpress.com/2010/11/02/fun-with-vim/
    Learn yourself some unix command line and acquire great power (all of the above helps the cause)
    When Brandon has time, do the brain dump.  It might take more than a day.

My primary goal is to get you indoctrinated into the linux platform.  Ubuntu is fine.  Redhat/Fedora is more of what you see around here, but I like ubuntu on the desktop personally (most agree).  Get comfortable with these tools, show me your progress.  It's a lot of work, but fun and extremely powerful once you get the hang of it.


<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
